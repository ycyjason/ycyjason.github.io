            collaborated closely with the product team to define user goals and

        <p class="body_text">
          Throughout my career as a product designer, I’ve collaborated closely
          with marketers and business owners, and I’ve seen firsthand the
          constraints they face, limited time, budget, and access to real data,
          when making strategic decisions. Personas are commonly used to align
          marketing efforts with customer needs and help teams across product
          lines better understand their audience. In early discovery interviews,
          users expressed frustration with the manual persona creation process,
          describing it as time-consuming, subjective, and often disconnected
          from real customer behaviour. Without data-backed personas, teams risk
          misaligned strategies and missed opportunities, underscoring the need
          for a faster, more reliable, and actionable solution.

        <p class="body_text">
          No matter how many times I start a design process, I always begin with
          research. It helps me understand the problem space, uncover
          opportunities, and gain the context needed to inform effective design
          decisions. For this project, I studied established persona frameworks
          to learn how marketers traditionally build personas. I also conducted
          competitor analysis to identify what existing tools do well and where
          they fall short, helping me define clear opportunities and position
          our product more strategically.

          <h2>Curiosity Drives Good Design</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
          I collaborated with the CPO and consulted clients to gather
          requirements for the persona feature. This informed which data and AI
          modules to use and what information would be most valuable. Throughout
          the process, I began developing a mindset that I believe every
          designer should embrace: asking questions and seeking clarity whenever
          possible. Doing so ensures we truly consider users' needs at every
          stage of the design process.

        <p class="quote_text">
          “Good design starts with good questions. Curiosity is how we uncover

        <br />
        <p class="body_text">
          Together, we developed a solution and created a standardised prompt
          for the LLM to generate persona outputs, providing marketers with an
          intuitive, data-backed way to build accurate personas that enhance
          audience targeting and drive conversions.

          <h2>Low-Fi, High Impact</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
          Before diving into visual design, I always start with sketching and
          wireframing. This step is crucial for organizing my thoughts and
          exploring different ways to present information effectively.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="body_text">
          For the AI persona feature, the key design challenge was maintaining
          simplicity. Since all information is data-driven, it was important to
          avoid overwhelming users with complex visuals. Each time I created
          wireframes, I focused on clearly structuring the LLM-generated outputs
          in the UI. I then gathered feedback from the team iteratively to
          ensure the design was informed by real input, not assumptions.

          <h2>Prototyping with Intent and Strategy</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
          I prototyped <b class="gradient-highlight">8 iterations</b> to
          validate assumptions around persona navigation, data display, and how
          users read and interpret the content. I learned that prototyping is
          not just about gathering feedback or testing the product; it’s about
          clearly defining what information you want from users, how you plan to
          collect it, and which aspects of the design you aim to evaluate.
          Without a clear strategy, prototyping can become aimless and
          inefficient. Working in a startup environment allowed me to
          continuously apply this strategic mindset, iterating designs multiple
          times based on solid user feedback to refine and improve the product.

                patterns or communication tone, ultimately hindering their

          <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
          Working on this project helped me uncover a deeper challenge in
          designing AI-powered experiences: while AI can automate and accelerate
          tasks like persona generation, it often lacks the nuance, emotion, and
          context that create a genuine human connection. I realised that
          bridging the gap between AI output and real user experience isn't just
          about functionality — it's about trust, relatability, and relevance.
          Many users shared that the personas felt too generic, making it hard
          to see their real customers reflected in the results. This experience
          taught me that to design more human AI experiences, we need to go
          beyond the output by embedding real data to build credibility,
          allowing interaction to foster engagement, and enabling
          personalisation to reflect unique user contexts. Designing with these
          principles brings AI closer to people, not just in utility, but in
          empathy.
