            The Four Seasons Hotel app was redesigned to address long-standing
            user pain points and enhance the overall experience. This redesign
            focuses on streamlining the reservation process and improving
            customer retention by integrating a loyalty rewards program to boost
            engagement and conversions.

          <p class="body_text">
            While studying Google’s UX course, I learned about industry design
            conventions and various methodologies. To reinforce my learning, I
            set myself a challenge: conducting a full-scale case study to apply
            my knowledge in a real-world scenario. Through this project, I went
            through the entire design cycle, from user research (empathising
            with and analysing user behaviour) to UI design (wire-framing and
            prototyping), followed by testing and iteration. This hands-on
            approach deepened my understanding of user-centric design and
            strengthened my ability to craft solutions that align with user
            needs.

        <p class="body_text">
          Since its launch nine years ago, the Four Seasons Hotel app has lacked
          updates based on user feedback, resulting in several usability
          challenges. The reservation process is overly complicated, making it
          frustrating for users to book seamlessly. Additionally, the lack of a
          reservation management feature creates inconvenience, preventing
          guests from modifying or tracking their bookings easily. With limited
          essential features, the app struggles to drive conversions, while the
          absence of direct communication channels leaves users feeling
          disconnected from resort staff. These pain points highlight the need
          for a comprehensive redesign to enhance usability, improve engagement,
          and streamline the booking experience.

          This project helped me apply the knowledge from the Google UX course
          to a real-world scenario, reinforcing key lessons on user-centric
          design. Initially, I believed my design would meet users' needs, but
          usability testing revealed minor issues that I hadn't anticipated.
          This taught me that user experience is personal and subjective, and we
          must avoid biases in our designs. Understanding users' true needs was
          challenging, but it highlighted the importance of being open-minded
          and putting the user at the centre of the design process. Conducting
          usability studies was the most rewarding part, showing me that
          effective design priorities functionality and usability over
          aesthetics.
