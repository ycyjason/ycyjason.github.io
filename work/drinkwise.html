            DrinkWise is a mobile app designed to help young Australians curb
            alcohol consumption through personalised support, habit tracking,
            and healthier social alternatives. As my capstone project for my
            master's degree, our team tackled the issue of alcohol abuse by
            creating a solution that promotes long-term behavioural change.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="body_text">
            In this project, I led a team of five computer science students,
            serving as the sole designer and front-end developer. Beyond
            crafting an intuitive UI and building a cohesive design system, I
            acted as the bridge between design and development, ensuring
            seamless implementation. I collaborated closely with developers,
            collecting feedback to refine interactions and translate designs
            into practical, scalable solutions. Additionally, I aligned
            individual contributions with project goals and timelines,
            reinforcing a strong balance between innovation and feasibility.

          From the outset, I prioritised understanding my team members‚Äô
          strengths and backgrounds to foster effective collaboration. Since we
          had never worked together before, I initiated conversations to align
          expectations and define clear project goals. To bridge the gap between
          design and development, I asked three key questions:

          implementation. This early alignment laid the groundwork for an

        <p class="body_text">
          When we first embarked on this project, we quickly realised the
          severity of alcohol overconsumption, especially among young adults.
          The issue became even more personal when some of our friends were
          involved in drunk driving incidents, nearly causing accidents and
          injuries. This firsthand experience reinforced our determination to
          tackle the problem. Through extensive research, we discovered that
          social pressure and stress were major contributors to frequent
          drinking habits, shaping our approach to design a solution that not
          only tracks alcohol intake but also offers healthier, socially
          engaging alternatives.

          Our design prioritises user freedom after discovering that many young
          adults feel dissatisfied when products overwhelm them with excessive
          control or information, especially when addressing personal habits.
          Instead of taking an intrusive approach, we designed features that
          gently guide users toward self-awareness and change, ensuring they
          feel empowered rather than restricted.

              The app was well-received for helping users track their drinking
              habits, set limits, and find alternative activities. While most
              found the notifications helpful, some requested more control over
              reminder timing. This led to an update allowing users to choose
              their preferred reminder days. Overall, the app was
              <b class="gradient-highlight">praised for its effectiveness</b> in
              reducing alcohol consumption.

          Wrapping up my Master's degree at UQ with the DrinkWise project has
          been an incredibly rewarding experience. Leading a cross-disciplinary
          team of five computer science students, we developed DrinkWise, a
          mobile app aimed at helping young Australians reduce alcohol
          consumption through habit tracking and personalised activity
          suggestions. As the only designer, I learned the importance of being
          open to new areas, like front-end development, and collaborated
          closely with the team to create a seamless design system that aligned
          with technical needs. This project not only honed my design and
          leadership skills but also fostered team bonding and personal growth.
          I‚Äôm proud of what we achieved and excited to bring these experiences
          into my future career as a product designer.
