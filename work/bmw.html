          <h1>BMW HK: Loyalty Rewards App</h1>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="body_text">
            The BMW HK Loyalty Rewards App was crafted to deepen customer
            relationships by providing a platform for exclusive rewards,
            privileges, and events. Users can earn points for brand engagement,
            redeem BMW-exclusive items, and enjoy access to members-only
            experiences. The app aims to boost user engagement and retention
            while embodying BMW's premium brand identity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="body_text">
            I was responsible for the app design and reported my duties to the
            lead. In this project, I utilised a data-driven approach to
            seamlessly align with BMW’s iconic branding while delivering a
            user-centric experience. By incorporating gamification features, I
            enhanced user engagement and retention. Working closely with BMW
            clients, developers, marketers, and data analysts, I ensured the app
            met business objectives, boosted conversions, and deeply resonated
            with its audience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="body_text">
            Due to company policy, much of my work on this project remains
            confidential. However, I’m able to share select aspects of the
            project. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to learn more.

        <p class="body_text">
          Data from similar loyalty reward apps revealed that retention rates
          decline over time, users often miss opportunities to redeem points
          before they expire, and many struggle to understand their membership
          tiers, privileges, and upgrade mechanisms. These challenges
          underscored the need for a solution that enhances clarity, engagement,
          and user satisfaction to improve loyalty program effectiveness.

          <h2>Integrating gamification for enhanced user engagement</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
          To create a more engaging and rewarding experience, I integrated
          gamification features into the app, ensuring users stayed motivated
          and actively interacted with the rewards system. Many users were
          unaware of their membership benefits, forgot to redeem points, or
          didn’t realise how close they were to unlocking new privileges. By
          incorporating interactive and personalised elements, I aimed to
          increase retention, encourage continuous engagement, and minimise lost
          benefits.

              <p class="body_text">
                I designed a push notification system that provided timely
                updates about points balance, tier progress, and reminders to
                redeem points before they expired. This helped keep users
                engaged and directed them back to the app to take action.

                I introduced an animated progress bar with personalised
                messages, encouraging users to earn more points. The progress
                bar clearly indicated how close users were to unlocking the next
                tier, while call-to-action (CTA) buttons guided them to complete
                missions and reach their goals.

                I wanted to provide clarity and make it easy for users to

                I established more interactive components across the design. For
                instance, users could tap on a tier label (e.g., “Silver”) to
                see related tips and information. This approach made it easier
                for users to understand the mechanisms behind tiers, privileges,
                and point earning without overwhelming them with excessive text.

          As I have resigned to pursue my studies, the next steps for this
          project will focus on refining the user experience and monitoring the
          impact of the new features. Key metrics such as user retention,
          redemption rates, and overall engagement will need to be tracked to
          assess the effectiveness of these features. Additionally, I recommend
          gathering user feedback through surveys or in-app prompts to identify
          any pain points and areas for improvement. Based on these insights,
          iteration on the design and adjustments to optimise the user journey
          will be necessary.
