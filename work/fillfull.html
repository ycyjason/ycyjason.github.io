            Fill Full is an e-commerce platform specialising in snack retail,
            designed to cater to busy professionals, families, and
            health-conscious individuals in Hong Kong. The website aims to
            provide a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience by offering a
            wide selection of snacks, all while focusing on user-centric design.

            I was responsible for analysing data collected from Google Analytics
            and transforming it into actionable insights to identify design
            opportunities. I took charge of designing the responsive website,
            ensuring it delivered an intuitive and seamless experience across
            devices. Additionally, I prepared design materials and developed the
            website, ensuring the design was effectively implemented through
            clean and efficient code.

          My work encompassed everything from creating design guidelines to
          developing a responsive website and implementing user-centred
          optimisations. It went beyond UX/UI design, also incorporating data
          analysis and web development. The following content highlights the key

            I created design guidelines for the graphic design team, making sure
            all marketing content was consistent and optimised for performance.
            I specified image dimensions, the brand style, and material sizes,
            so the content would not only look good but also perform well on the
            site.

            I took charge of designing and developing a fully responsive
            website, making sure it worked seamlessly across desktop, tablet,
            and mobile. This process involved fixing any UI flaws and resolving
            usability issues to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for
            users, no matter the device.

            I developed a product recommendation module that suggests products
            based on users' browsing habits. My goal was to create a
            personalised experience that would help boost the conversion rate by
            guiding users toward products they’re most likely to be interested
            in.

            I optimised the page layout to increase product page views. Using
            insights from Hotjar, I analysed user behaviour and redesigned the
            page layout to highlight new campaigns and prompt users to engage more with
            the content.

          Throughout this project, collaboration played a key role in shaping
          the final outcome. I worked closely with the marketing team and
          graphic designers to ensure their expectations and requirements were
          fully understood and integrated into the design. Storytelling was an
          essential skill for presenting my ideas, making them more relatable
          and engaging for the team. Additionally, taking a data-driven approach
          was crucial in making the UX improvements measurable. By using data, I
          was able to validate my hypotheses and demonstrate the real impact of
          the changes, which made the process even more rewarding
